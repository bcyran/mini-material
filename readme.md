# Mini Material

## About
Mini Material is a simple library of Material Design based elements. It uses only CSS, thus it's small and light. Mini Material is not meant to build your entire site; think of it as a collection of elements to use when needed.

The main concept while creating MM was to interfere with your HTML code structure and semantics as little as possible. Mini material influences only the look of your site and doesn't force you to create giant non semantic stuctures.

## Demo
